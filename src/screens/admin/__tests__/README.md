## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Mock Services
- `adminService` - Bike CRUD operations
- `imageUploadService` - Image upload functionality
- `bikeService` - Additional bike operations
- React Navigation - Navigation mocks
- Expo modules - Image picker, file system

### Test Utilities
- `@testing-library/react-native` - Component testing
- `jest` - Test framework
- Custom mocks for React Native components

## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Common Issues
1. **Mock not working**
   ```bash
   # Clear Jest cache
   npx jest --clearCache
   ```

2. **Async operations timing out**
   ```javascript
   // Increase timeout in test
   await waitFor(() => {
     expect(element).toBeTruthy();
   }, { timeout: 5000 });
   ```

3. **Component not rendering**
   ```javascript
   // Check mock setup in setup.ts
   // Verify all required props are provided
   ```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
npm run test:bike-management -- --verbose

# Run single test with debug
npx jest src/screens/admin/__tests__/BikeManagementScreen.test.tsx --verbose --no-cache

# Run with coverage details
npm run test:coverage -- --verbose
```

## 📈 Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: BikeManagement Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
